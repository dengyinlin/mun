<p style="text-align: justify; line-height:200%;font-size:125%;">Welcome to the inaugural edition of <b>IIT-BHU MUN</b> in <b>Kashiyatra'13</b> - <i>The storm is here</i>. Model United Nations, popularly known as MUN is by far the spohisticated kind of debate and discussion which apart from testing your diplomatic skills also tests your knowledge on world affairs. This combination is one to look out for.
Come this January, delegates from all over the country will be gathered in the lecture theatre complex of IIT (BHU) Varanasi to diplomatically battle it out with the other countries to solve grave world issues. 
</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height:200%;font-size:125%;">Although this might be our first shot at organizing a MUN but we, the students of IIT (BHU) Varanasi believe that this can mark the beginning of a very rich tradition and IIT BHU MUN can become one of the most esteemed MUNs of the country. IIT BHU MUN will be held on the 2nd and the 3rd day of Kashiyatra'13 i.e. 25th and 26th of January 2013 and the Valedictory ceremony shall be held on the 27th.
So participate in the IIT BHU MUN and be a part of the beginning of a tradition.</p>
